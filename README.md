# LangFlow Hackthon


_Simple Docker wrapper for [LangFlow](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow)._

[![Build and push Docker image to GHCR](https://github.com/tlaanemaa/langflow-docker/actions/workflows/build-and-push-image.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tlaanemaa/langflow-docker/actions/workflows/build-and-push-image.yml)

This is basically just a copy-paste of [their docker example](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow/tree/dev/docker_example), so that you don't need to clone the whole repository.

## Running

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hyper07/langflow-hackthon.git
cd langflow-docker
docker compose up
```

The web UI will be accessible on port [7860](http://localhost:7860/)
